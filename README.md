Hi everyone, welcome to my first code:

<div align = "center" >
<img src = "https://github.com/TheeViolinist/Library.c/blob/master/src/assets/to_readme/welcome.png" width = "700px"/>
</div>

This is database code of a library and it's interface where you can do whatever you want, add a book of math? Yes, you can, add a book 
of geography? Yes, you can. but how? Look this >

<img src = "https://github.com/TheeViolinist/Library.c/blob/master/src/assets/to_readme/data1.png" width = "300px"/> <img src = "https://github.com/TheeViolinist/Library.c/blob/master/src/assets/to_readme/data2.png" width = "300px"/>

Now you can do whatever you want, add a name, writer and contente to a book.

Best of all, this was all done in C.
For now it's just a database center, but after that it will be the best library programming ever.

			Thank you
